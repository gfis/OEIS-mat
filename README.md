# OEIS-mat
OEIS-mat is a workbench project for the extraction of structured data from the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS, https://oeis.org). 
Such data are regularily extracted from the OEIS and then loaded into a series of database tables that are later used for various consistency checks and program
generation processes, especially in the sister project https://github.com/gfis/joeis-lite.
