# OEIS-mat
## OEIS maintenance and technical material 

A collection of small projects around the non-mathematical aspects of Neil Sloane's [On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences® (OEIS®)](https://oeis.org/), among them:
* [Broken link detection and repair](https://oeis.org/w/index.php?title=User:Georg_Fischer/Broken_link_maintenance)
* [Coincidence (duplicates) search](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Georg_Fischer/Coincidences)
* [EIS-Expo](http://www.teherba.org/OEIS-mat/EIS-Expo/index.html) - Math and Musik exhibition in Heidelberg, Germany, May 2019

The projects attempt an automatic analysis of various fields in the OEIS sequence data by using open source tools, mainly:
* Perl scripts and makefiles
* Unix commandline tools: wget, make, sed, grep, cut, find/xargs, diff etc.
* SQL database tables
* Database visualization in HTML with [Dbat](https://github.com/gfis/dbat)
